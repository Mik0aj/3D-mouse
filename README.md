# 3D Mouse Based on Gyroscope
This project is a 3D mouse that uses a gyroscope to detect movements and has six degrees of freedom (6 DOF). The device is controlled by an Arduino Pro Micro and an MPU-6050 sensor, and features two buttons for additional input. The mouse is designed using 3D printed compliant mechanisms that utilize springs to provide a tactile feedback.

## Hardware Components
* Arduino Pro Micro: This microcontroller board is based on the ATmega32u4 chip and is used to control the mouse's movements and buttons.
* MPU-6050 Sensor: This is a 6-axis gyro and accelerometer module that detects the device's orientation and acceleration.
* Two Buttons: These buttons are used to provide additional input to the device.

## 3D Printed Compliant Mechanisms:
These mechanisms are designed using springs that provide a tactile feedback to the user.
Software Components
The software for the 3D mouse is written in Arduino's programming language and is used to read the sensor data, control the device's movements, and process the button input.

## Setup and Usage
To use the 3D mouse, connect the Arduino Pro Micro and the MPU-6050 sensor to your computer. Then, upload the provided code to the Arduino board. The mouse can be used in any application that supports 6 DOF input, such as 3D modeling software or video games.
